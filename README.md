# API - Hacedor de Horarios
- **This is a WIP project, for now I just have finished the backend and I am currently working on the frontend with ReactJS**
- *Project made with FastAPI*
- This projects uses [this repo](https://github.com/BubuDavid/DCI_hacedor_horarios_module) that I also created. This is the logic behind the schedule maker, you should consider to clone taht repo to run this one and paste the "py_sceduler" folder in the root of this project. (You should clone the repo and then change the name to "py_scheduler"). 
- The frontend could be found in [this repo](https://github.com/BubuDavid/DCI_hacedor_horarios_frontend)

- ("Hacedor" no es una palabra, pero est√° chistosa)
